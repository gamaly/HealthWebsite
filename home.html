            <h3 style="max-width:80%;margin:auto;text-align:justify">Patient had normal or near-normal blood counts in all periodic tests through early December 2017, but has had pancytopenia since at least late January 2018. Patient experienced painful swelling in right foot starting mid-January. On January 18, primary care doctor diagnosed an infection and prescribed Cefadroxil antibiotic. Over next few days, foot became more swollen with a large deep-red/purple patch on top of foot. On January 22, doctor increased dosage of Cefadroxil, added a second antibiotic (Sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim), and ordered blood tests. Because blood tests revealed very low platelet and white blood cell counts, patient went to emergency room and was admitted to hospital. The initial diagnosis was that the low counts resulted from one or more medications patient had been taking. Cefadroxil and Methazolamide were identified as the primary suspects. Aplastic anemia was also suspected, but was ruled out by pathologist during hospital stay. Tests also ruled out cancer. Patient stayed in hospital for 30 days, had periodic infusions of platelets and RBCs, but platelet, RBC, and WBC counts never increased to normal range. Patient was discharged from hospital on February 21, has had thrice-weekly blood draws since then, and has had additional infusions as required.</h3>
